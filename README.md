# Node.js Contact Form with Pug

## Project Overview

This is my first **backend project** built using **Node.js** and **Pug**. The project allows users to submit their details through a **Contact Form**, which are then saved to a **.txt file** using the **fs module**. The data is later fetched from the file and displayed dynamically on an **About Page** using **Pug** templates.

## Features

- **Contact Form**: Users can submit their details (name, email, and message).
- **Data Storage**: User data is saved in a **.txt file** on the server.
- **Dynamic Page Rendering**: The data from the **.txt file** is fetched and rendered on the **About Page** using **Pug** templates.
- **File Handling**: Learn how to handle files in **Node.js** using the **fs** module.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime built for server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: Minimal web framework for building web applications with Node.js.
- **Pug**: Templating engine for dynamic HTML page rendering.
- **FS module**: File System module in Node.js used to read and write files.
